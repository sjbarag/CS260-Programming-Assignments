COMPILATION & EXECUTION
	For all:
		make
	For individual questions:
		make q{1..12}
	If the .py files do need execution permissions on your system:
		make permissions
	This option exists so that you don't automatically have to elevate the
	permissions for these files (even though they only elevate for you).
